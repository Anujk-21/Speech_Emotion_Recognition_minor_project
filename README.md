## Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

<p>This repository explores and implements techniques for automatically recognizing emotions from speech, a field within the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Emotional Analysis: Extract emotional cues from vocal features like pitch, timbre, and energy.</li>
    <li>Machine Learning: Train models to classify emotional states based on extracted features.</li>
    <li>Librosa: Utilize the powerful audio analysis library for feature extraction and processing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Librosa and Feature Extraction</h3>

<p>Librosa provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing audio signals, including extracting emotion-relevant features such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs): Capture spectral information related to timbre and vocal quality.</li>
    <li>Prosody Features: Analyze pitch, energy, and speaking rate, often indicative of emotional states.</li>
    <li>Spectral Centroid: Measure the "brightness" of the speech signal, potentially reflecting happiness or excitement.</li>
</ul>

<p>This repository dives deeper into various SER approaches, utilizing Librosa for effective feature extraction and building robust models for accurate emotion classification.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for further updates and explore the code to delve into the fascinating world of speech emotion recognition!</p>
